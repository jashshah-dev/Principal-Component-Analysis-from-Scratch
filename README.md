# Background


This project focuses on performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch on the 130 Hospitals Diabetic Dataset from the US. PCA is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique that helps uncover the underlying structure and patterns in high-dimensional data.

In this project, we aim to explore the applicability of PCA on healthcare data by applying it to the 130 Hospitals Diabetic Dataset. This dataset contains comprehensive information about diabetic patients, including patient demographics, medical history, treatment details, and hospital-specific data. By implementing PCA from scratch, we gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical principles involved in the PCA algorithm and how it can be applied to real-world healthcare datasets.

The dataset consists of a large number of features, making it a suitable candidate for dimensionality reduction techniques. By leveraging PCA, we aim to identify the most important features that contribute to the overall variance in the dataset. This process allows us to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most relevant information.

Through this project, we aim to showcase the practical application of PCA in the healthcare domain and provide insights into the potential benefits of using dimensionality reduction techniques for analyzing and understanding complex healthcare datasets.

Feel free to customize and enhance the background section further based on your project's specific goals and context!
